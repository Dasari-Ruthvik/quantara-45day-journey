## What I Learned Today

### useState Hook

- Used to add state to components
- Returns [value, setValue]
- Example: const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

### Questions I Have

- How does React know when to re-render?
- Can I have multiple useState in one component?

### What Confused Me

- The syntax `{count}` in JSX
- When to use () vs {}
